# Molecular-dynamics-simulations-parallel-analysis
parallel_analysis.sh has been designed to visualize and analyze data from MD. It processes and plots various metrics such as RMSD and minimum distances over time. The script generates graphs for each metric, showing both the raw data and a moving average to highlight trends. You can use plot_data to plot the results.
